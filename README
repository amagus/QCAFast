In beyond silicon research, Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) emerged as a candidate for replacing the traditional CMOS logic circuits. QCA is a paradigm based on the exchange of information between cells that take advantage of Coulomb's law. In this work, we present techniques that expand and accelerate the validation of designs created using QCADesigner simulator. The circuit is split into small independent regions which could be verified for common mistakes such as cell misplacements and synchronization issues. Those small circuits chops can also be arranged for parallel simulation allowing speed ups of approximately five times faster. The output from such devices can be used to build a model where logical prepositions could be evaluated.  The entire process can vastly reduce the time for full circuitry validation and help adoption of the paradigm.
